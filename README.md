# Rackit

Rackit is a module for managing large collections of files on Rackspace Cloud Files. Rackit automatically creates containers as needed, and reauthenticates when the API token expires. Rackit also supports the generation of temporary, time-limited file URLs.

Cloud Files has a recommended limit of 100,000,000 files per container. Rackit knows this, and will automatically create new containers as necessary.

With Rackit, you specify a container prefix, such as 'file'. Then, Rackit will create containers ['file0', 'file1', ...] as necessary. Files can be uploded by passing local paths or readable streams.

# Install

    $ npm install rackit

# Usage
`````javascript
var rackit = require('rackit');
    
// Initialize with your account information
rackit.init({
	'user' : '<your Rackspace username>',
	'key' : '<your Rackspace API key>'
}, function(err) {
	// Add a local file to the cloud
	rackit.add(__dirname + '/image.jpg', function(err, cloudpath) {
		// Get the CDN URI of the file
		console.log(rackit.getURI(cloudpath));

		// The cloudpath parameter uniquely identifies this file, and is used by other Rackit methods to manipulate it.
		// We should probably store the cloudpath somewhere.
	});
});
`````

Optionally, you may create your own Rackit instance. This is necessary if you are accessing multiple Cloud File accounts.
`````javascript
var Rackit = require('rackit').Rackit;
var myRackit = new Rackit({
	'user' : '<your Rackspace username>',
	'key' : '<your Rackspace API key>'
});

myRackit.init(function(err) {
	// Add a local file to the cloud
	myRackit.add(__dirname + '/image.jpg', function(err, cloudpath) {
		// Get the CDN URI of the file
		console.log(myRackit.getURI(cloudpath));
	});
});
`````

# Options

When initializing Rackit, here are the options and defaults:
`````javascript
{
	user : '', // Your Rackspace username
	key : '', // Your Rackspace API key
	prefix : 'dev', // The prefix for your Cloud Files containers (may contain forward slash)
	authRegion : 'US', // Specifies the authentication API entry point - other option of 'UK'
	region : '', // Specifies the geographic datacenter to prefer - defaults to the user's default region. Explicit options of 'ORD', 'DFW', 'HKG', 'LON', 'IAD', 'SYD' are accepted.
	tempURLKey : null, // A secret for generating temporary URLs
	useSNET : false,
	useCDN : true,
	useSSL : true, // Specifies whether to use SSL (https) for CDN links
	verbose : false, // If set to true, log messages will be generated
	logger : console.log // Function to receive log messages
}
`````
        
# Methods
### #add(source, [options,] callback)
- source - Either a path to the local file to upload, or a readable stream.
- options - A hash of additional options
  - type - A MIME type (e.g. 'Image/JPEG'). If not specified, mime-magic is used for local files, and the Content-Type header is checked for ServerRequest streams.
  - filename - What to name the file on Cloud Files. Omit to have Rackit generate a UID.
  - meta - A hash of additional metadata to store along with the file (prefixed with 'X-Object-Meta-' automatically).
  - headers - A hash of additional headers to send.
- callback(err, cloudpath) - returns information about the location of the file. `cloudpath` is in the form 'container/file-name' and is used as input to other methods to uniquely identify a file. I recommend storing the `cloudpath` in your database, although you could also store a CDN url.

Uploads a file to the cloud. The uploaded file will be given a random 24-character file name, unless specified.

Here is an example of passing a stream to Rackit:
`````javascript
var http = require('http');
http.get('http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png', function(res) {
	// We have receieved request headers, but no data yet. Send the stream to Rackit!
	rackit.add(res, function(err, cloudpath) {
		if (err) return;
		console.log('file added!');
		console.log('see it here:', rackit.getURI(cloudpath));
	}
});
`````

### #list(callback)
- callback(err, cloudpaths)

Returns an array of all uploaded objects in prefixed containers.

### #get(cloudpath, [localPath], [callback])
- cloudpath - of the form 'container/file-name'
- localPath - where to put the downloaded file
- callback(err, response, body)
- returns a readable stream

Downloads a file from the cloud. Returns a readable stream, or can write directly to a file.

### #remove(cloudpath, callback)

Permanently deletes a file from the cloud.

### #setMeta(cloudpath, meta, callback)

Upserts the metadata for the specified cloud file.

### #getMeta(cloudpath, callback)
- cloudpath - of the form 'container/file-name'
- callback(err, meta)

Retrieves the metadata for the specified cloud file. An error will be returned if the file does not exist.

### #getURI(cloudpath [, ttl])

Returns a URI for a given file. If the ttl parameter is omitted, then a CDN URI will be returned (if the container is CDN enabled). If ttl is specified, a temporary URI will be given which is valid for ttl seconds.

### #getCloudpath(uri)

Opposite of getURI. Returns a Cloudpath string given a file's CDN or temporary URI. The Cloudpath can then be used as input to other Rackit methods.

# TODO

* Add periodic updating of cached container info, in case things are modified externally
* Add ability to specify container size limit
* Finish writing test cases
